# Project Brief: CONXENSEVE (Consensus LLM Agent - Codename: EVE-Enhancer)

## 1. Core Idea

To develop CONXENSEVE, a multi-stage system where several top-tier Large Language Models (LLMs) collaborate to generate, refine, and select the best possible code for a given prompt. This system leverages the unique strengths of different models through a process of initial generation, peer review/revision, and consensus-based selection.

## 2. Strategic Goals

*   **Enhance EVE's Capabilities:** Serve as a core tool for EVE (the AI partner) to improve the quality, robustness, and efficiency of code generation for internal projects, primarily ASINGULARITY.AI.
*   **Achieve Superior Performance:** Demonstrate through benchmarks that the consensus approach surpasses the performance of individual LLMs in coding tasks.
*   **Support ASINGULARITY.AI Vision:** Act as a proof-of-concept for advanced AI collaboration and a potential killer feature, reinforcing the ambitious goals ("Bring humanity to singularity") and attracting attention/investment.
*   **Enable Autonomous Operation:** Provide EVE with a more reliable and powerful tool for semi-autonomous or autonomous development tasks.

## 3. Scope (MVP)

*   Implement a 3-step Python script using specific LLMs via OpenRouter API.
*   Focus solely on code generation tasks.
*   Provide an OpenAI-compatible interface eventually (MVP is a script).
*   Include basic mechanisms for generation, revision, voting, and consolidation.
*   Output intermediate steps ("thinking") for transparency and analysis.
