# Progress: CONXENSEVE

**Date:** 2024-07-30

## Current Status: MVP Ready for Initial Testing with Docker Support

**What Works:**
*   Basic project structure created (`main.py`, `requirements.txt`).
*   Core 3-step consensus logic (Generation, Revision, Voting/Consolidation) implemented in `main.py`.
*   Integration with OpenRouter API via `openai` library is functional.
*   Specific LLMs (`claude-3.7-sonnet:thinking`, `gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25:free`, `deepseek/deepseek-r1`, `claude-3.7-sonnet`) are configured.
*   Tailored prompts for revision and voting steps are implemented.
*   Basic vote counting and winner selection logic exists.
*   Script can be run from the command line, accepting a user prompt.
*   Initial Memory Bank files created and populated.
*   Docker setup complete (`Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`).
*   Environment configuration templates (`.env.example`, `.gitignore`).
*   Updated README with Docker instructions.

**What's Left (MVP Scope):**
*   User testing and feedback gathering.

**What's Left (Post-MVP / Future Iterations):**
*   Refinement of prompts based on testing.
*   Implementation of robust context handling (especially for DeepSeek R1).
*   Improved error handling (e.g., for malformed votes, API errors beyond basic retry).
*   More sophisticated vote analysis/tie-breaking.
*   Benchmarking against individual models.
*   Development of an OpenAI-compatible API wrapper (e.g., using FastAPI).
*   Potential for dynamic model selection or weighting.

**Known Issues/Risks (MVP):**
*   DeepSeek R1 context limit might be hit with complex prompts, potentially causing errors (currently unhandled).
*   Vote parsing relies on a simple format ("N - ...") and might fail with unexpected LLM responses.
*   Tie-breaking logic is simplistic (defaults to first in list).
*   Latency will be noticeable due to sequential API calls.
*   Cost implications of using multiple premium models.
