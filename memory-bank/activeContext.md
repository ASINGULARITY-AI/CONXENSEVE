# Active Context: CONXENSEVE (Current Focus)

**Date:** 2024-07-30

**Current Phase:** Dockerization & Preparation for Testing

**Immediate Focus:**
1.  **Docker Setup:** Created `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to containerize the application.
2.  **Memory Bank Update:** Updated `techContext.md` to reflect the use of Docker.
3.  **.env File Reminder:** Ensure the `.env` file exists in the project root with the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` before running Docker Compose.

**Next Steps:**
1.  **Docker Build & Run:** User (Adam) to build and run the application using `docker compose up --build`.
2.  **Initial Testing (via Docker):** User (Adam) to interact with the running container, providing coding prompts.
3.  **Observation & Analysis:** Monitor the console output (intermediate steps) and the final result.
4.  **Feedback Gathering:** Collect observations on performance, errors, prompt effectiveness, and overall workflow within the Docker environment.
5.  **Iteration Planning:** Based on feedback, plan potential improvements.

**Open Questions/Decisions:**
*   How robust is the MVP's vote parsing and tie-breaking logic in practice?
*   Will the context limits of DeepSeek R1 pose a problem with moderately complex prompts in the MVP?
