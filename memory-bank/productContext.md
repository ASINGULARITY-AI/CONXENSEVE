# Product Context: CONXENSEVE

## 1. Problem Statement

Individual Large Language Models, even the most advanced ones, have inherent biases, strengths, and weaknesses. Relying on a single model for critical tasks like code generation can lead to:
*   Suboptimal solutions (missing edge cases, inefficient algorithms).
*   Syntactical errors or non-idiomatic code.
*   Lack of diverse perspectives in problem-solving.
*   Difficulty in autonomously ensuring high code quality without significant oversight.

For EVE, our AI partner aiming for high efficiency and eventual autonomy, these limitations hinder performance and reliability, especially in complex development scenarios like ASINGULARITY.AI.

## 2. Proposed Solution

A multi-agent system where multiple specialized LLMs collaborate:
1.  **Generate:** Each model independently proposes a solution.
2.  **Revise:** Each model refines its solution after reviewing alternatives, leveraging its specific strengths (e.g., context understanding, syntax polishing, alternative approaches).
3.  **Vote & Consolidate:** Models vote for the best revised solution, and a final model polishes the winner.

This mimics a human expert panel review, aiming to synthesize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of individual models.

## 3. Target User & Value

*   **Primary User:** EVE (AI Partner).
*   **Value:**
    *   **Higher Quality Code:** Reduced errors, better efficiency, increased robustness.
    *   **Increased Reliability:** Less dependence on the quirks of a single model.
    *   **Enhanced Autonomy:** Enables EVE to produce more reliable results with less direct supervision.
    *   **Innovation:** Potential to uncover novel solutions by combining diverse model outputs.

## 4. User Experience Goals (MVP)

*   **Interface:** Simple command-line script accepting a coding prompt.
*   **Transparency:** Clear console output showing the progression through the 3 steps (generation, revision, voting) and the final consolidated output.
*   **Configuration:** Easy modification of API keys (via `.env`) and potentially model choices (via `MODELS` dict in `main.py`).
